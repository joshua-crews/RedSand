# Config options for engine based computations such as province resolution

# Each iterative level of detail of the planet, minimum of resolution of 2+
# Minimum number of lods is 1 level of detail
planet_lods:
  - 10
  - 30
    # - 50
    # - 100

# World space scale of the planet object. Higher scale means greater distance between vertices
planet_scale: 1

# The rendered texture dimensions for internal map handling
# Each resolution added further slows app boot time but provides more fidelity
map_dimensions: 30

# The maximum number of province instances to be generated
# There is no promise the noise will allow all those points to be used however, so it is only a maximum
num_provinces: 20

# Number of times to reduce a texture mapped to a face of a planet in size
# Bigger number means more times the texture is repeated, with 1 being the texture is used once on scale
uv_scale: 2
